| **VPC** | EC2 lives inside VPC | Networking, subnets, security groups |
| **EBS** | Storage volumes for EC2 | Root volumes, data persistence |
| **IAM** | Instance profiles / roles | Permissions to access S3, DynamoDB, etc. |
| **CloudWatch** | Metrics and logs from instances | Monitoring CPU, RAM, custom metrics |
| **Auto Scaling** | Automatic instance management | Scale out/in based on demand |
| **ELB** | Traffic distribution | Load balancing across multiple instances |
| **S3** | Artifact storage | User data scripts, backups, static assets |
| **RDS** | Database backend | EC2 app servers + RDS database |
| **Route 53** | DNS routing | Map domains to instances or load balancers |
