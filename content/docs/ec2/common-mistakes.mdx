## 1. SSH Timeout Even Though Security Group is Correct

**Why it happens**: Your ISP may block outbound port 22 due to security policies.

**How to diagnose**:
```bash
# Test 1: Can you reach port 80?
curl http://[instance-ip]  # If it works, it's not AWS

# Test 2: Verify SSH specifically
nc -zv [instance-ip] 22    # If timeout, it's local network issue
```

**Solution**:
- Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager (doesn't require port 22)
- Change SSH to alternative port (e.g., 2222, 443)
- Contact your ISP or use VPN

## 2. Forgetting to Adjust Keypair Permissions

**Why it happens**: SSH rejects files with overly permissive settings for security.

**Typical error**: `WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!`

**Solution**:
```bash
chmod 400 my-keypair.pem  # Always after creating keypair
```

## 3. Exhausting CPU Credits on T Instances Without Realizing It

**Why it happens**: Sustained loads consume credits faster than accumulation.

**Symptom**: Instance becomes slow after hours of load, but CloudWatch shows low CPU usage (because it's throttled to baseline).

**Solution**:
- Monitor `CPUCreditBalance` metric in CloudWatch
- If consistently low, migrate to M family or enable Unlimited mode (with cost awareness)

## 4. Unexpected Elastic IP Costs

**Why it happens**: Allocated but not attached = $0.005/hour.

**Solution**:
```bash
# List orphaned EIPs
aws ec2 describe-addresses \
  --query 'Addresses[?AssociationId==null]'

# Release immediately if not used
aws ec2 release-address --allocation-id eipalloc-xxxxx
```

## 5. Losing Data When Terminating Instance

**Why it happens**: `DeleteOnTermination: true` on EBS volume (default).

**Prevention**:
- For critical data, always set `DeleteOnTermination: false`
- Create snapshots before major changes
- Use RDS/DynamoDB for databases instead of EBS

## 6. Not Verifying Status Checks Before Diagnosing

**Why it happens**: Assuming "running" = "functional".

**Solution**:
```bash
# Always verify detailed status checks
aws ec2 describe-instance-status --instance-ids i-xxxxx
```
Look for `InstanceStatus: ok` and `SystemStatus: ok` before investigating networking.
