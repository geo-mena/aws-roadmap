## What Generates Costs in EC2

| Component | Cost | Unit |
|-----------|------|------|
| **Running instance** | Varies by type | Per hour |
| **EBS volumes** | ~$0.08-$0.10/GB | Per GB-month |
| **Unassociated Elastic IP** | $0.005/hour | Per hour |
| **Data transfer OUT** | $0.09/GB after 100GB | Per GB |
| **EBS snapshots** | ~$0.05/GB | Per GB-month |

## Cost Optimization

### Free Tier (first 12 months)
- 750 hours/month of `t2.micro` or `t3.micro` (Linux)
- 30 GB of EBS General Purpose (gp2 or gp3)
- 1 GB of snapshots

### Optimization Strategies

**1. Right-sizing**: Start with `t3.micro`, scale based on CloudWatch metrics

**2. Stop vs Terminate**: For dev/test, stop when not in use (don't pay for compute, only EBS)

**3. Spot Instances**: 70-90% discount for fault-tolerant workloads (not covered yet)

**4. Reserved/Savings Plans**: Up to 72% discount for predictable workloads (not covered yet)

## Cost Monitoring

```bash
# View costs by instance type
aws ce get-cost-and-usage \
  --time-period Start=2025-10-01,End=2025-10-10 \
  --granularity DAILY \
  --metrics UnblendedCost \
  --group-by Type=DIMENSION,Key=INSTANCE_TYPE
```

<Callout type="info">
Always monitor your costs regularly. Unexpected charges usually come from resources left running or unassociated Elastic IPs.
