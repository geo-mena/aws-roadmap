## Security

- [ ] **Never** expose port 22 to `0.0.0.0/0` - use specific IP or Session Manager
- [ ] Use security groups with least privilege principle
- [ ] Rotate keypairs periodically and store them securely
- [ ] Enable encryption on EBS volumes (`Encrypted: true`)
- [ ] Use IAM roles instead of hardcoding credentials in instances
- [ ] Keep OS updated (`yum update -y` in user data)

## Cost Optimization

- [ ] Set `DeleteOnTermination: true` for ephemeral instances
- [ ] Release Elastic IPs that aren't in use
- [ ] Monitor CPU Credits on T instances - consider M family if constantly bursting
- [ ] Use appropriate sizes - start small and scale based on metrics
- [ ] Consider Reserved Instances or Savings Plans for predictable workloads
- [ ] Terminate dev instances outside working hours

## Performance

- [ ] Choose instance type based on actual bottleneck (CPU vs RAM vs I/O)
- [ ] Use gp3 instead of gp2 for better cost/performance
- [ ] For I/O intensive workloads, consider Instance Store or io2 EBS
- [ ] Launch instances in Availability Zone close to users
- [ ] Enable detailed monitoring if you need metrics every 1 min

## Reliability

- [ ] Never use a single instance in production - design for multiple AZs
- [ ] Implement proper health checks
- [ ] Automate deployments with user data or config management
- [ ] Create AMIs of configured instances for fast recovery
- [ ] Configure automated snapshots of critical EBS volumes

## Operational Excellence

- [ ] Use consistent tags (`Name`, `Environment`, `Project`, `Owner`)
- [ ] Document in user data what's installed and why
- [ ] Use CloudWatch for centralized logs
- [ ] Implement Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation/Terraform)
- [ ] Maintain inventory of instances and their purposes
