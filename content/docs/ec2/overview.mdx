title: EC2 Overview
description: Executive summary and key concepts of Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud).
---

**Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** is AWS's virtual computing service that lets you launch and manage virtual servers (instances) in the cloud.

**Problem it solves**: Eliminates the need to buy, configure, and maintain physical hardware to run applications. Provides scalable and on-demand compute capacity.

**When to use it**:
- You need full control over the operating system and configuration
- Apps that require persistent resources (web servers, databases, workers)
- Predictable workloads or those requiring dedicated instances

**Alternatives**:
- **Lambda**: For serverless code without server management
- **ECS/Fargate**: For containers without managing infrastructure
- **Lightsail**: For simple cases with predefined configuration

## Key Concepts

### Instance Types

Hardware families that define CPU, RAM, storage, and networking. Nomenclature: `[family][generation].[size]` (e.g., `t3.medium`, `m5.xlarge`)

### Keypairs

SSH key pair (public/private) for secure authentication. AWS stores the public key, you keep the private one.

### Security Groups

Virtual firewall at the instance level that controls inbound (ingress) and outbound (egress) traffic using rules based on ports and CIDRs.

### User Data Scripts

Bash scripts that run automatically when launching an instance (only on first boot). They're useful for software installation and initial configuration.

### EBS (Elastic Block Store)

Persistent storage volumes that connect to EC2 instances like "virtual hard drives". They exist independently of instances.

### Elastic IP

Static public IP address that persists even if you stop/restart the instance. You're charged if it's allocated but not associated with a running instance.

### CPU Credits (T instances)

Burst performance system for T family. You accumulate credits when using less than baseline, spend them when needing more CPU.

### AMI (Amazon Machine Image)

Template that contains the operating system, applications, and configuration to launch instances.
